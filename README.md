Website Modules for www.vauxoo.com.
===

On this branch you will find all the set of landing pages, features for cms and interactive elements which built toghether www.vauxoo.com and we decide for one reason or another not make them public.

Reasons because a module can be here.
---

1. The module is our own content to promote a product/service.
2. The feature is to give us a competitive advange and such feature is related to our process with no posibility to be generic.
3. It is a huge PoC which we are not sure it can be public for security/strategic reason.
4. It is a configuration module.
5. It is a overwrite of a formal report with our wired information.
6. It is NOT a website_* module which should be in the frontend on this other [repository](http://github.com/Vauxoo/page).
 
**If you are not on 1 to 6:** please create a module in [addons-vauxoo](https://github.com/addons-vauxoo).

This tests is what I need "only" tested/mixed with dependency repositories, and tested 1 by 1 modules on this repository in order to be sure they are all installables.

Hacking Our Website
---

Every module can work independent or not, you can find the app installer on [this repository](https://git.vauxoo.com/vauxoo/instance),
please check the [README](https://git.vauxoo.com/vauxoo/instance/blob/master/README.md) file there for more precise information.

The main idea is create a little how-to commit by commit to know how create our own themes, website features and services offers in a clean way.

TODO: Create a guide to build with t2d and the process to launch the instance with a copy of production for future references.
